# What this is: the one-command installer for the sco-relay server on a plain Linux machine. Run it as root from your own
# copy of this repository:
#
#     sudo sh server/deploy/install.sh
#
# It builds only the relay from this tree, installs it as /usr/local/bin/sco-relay with an account of its own and one
# protected config file, and runs it: as a systemd service that starts at boot, or, where systemd is not running, in the
# foreground as that account (the command does not return; Ctrl+C or SIGTERM stops the relay, which exits 0). Run again,
# it upgrades the program and keeps the config, and with it the passphrase your players already hold.
#
# Root runs cmake and the compiler on this tree, so the script works on a copy of its own and never on the tree you ran
# it from: it copies the tree (without .git and build folders) into a new folder under /var/tmp, as root, keeping owners
# and modes; checks that copy; and configures and builds only the copy. The folder is new every run (never one that was
# there before), owned by root and closed to everyone else, and removed when the script ends. The check is a safeguard
# against common mistakes, such as a clone with loose permissions or a stray symlink. It is not a defence against someone
# who already controls your copy: root builds and runs what is in it, so run it only from a copy you trust. What it
# checks is said where it happens below, and in server/deploy/README.md.
#
# Network use: the package manager, only when a build tool is missing and only on Debian and Ubuntu; and the build's
# one download, the pinned SDK files that cmake/ScoSdk.cmake and cmake/ScoCoreSource.cmake fetch and check against a
# SHA-256 kept in this repository. The relay itself opens one UDP port and nothing else. The firewall is not touched.
# server/deploy/README.md describes every step and what to open for your players.
