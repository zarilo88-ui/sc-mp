# Prove the source include allowlist stays narrow while the Linux-only build gate accepts the guarded Windows SDK
# headers used by the relay, checks the shared relay wire header, and rejects system-header shadows. Run the real
# checker on temporary source copies so the checkout is never modified.
#
# The first cases (the Windows headers, a path that climbs out of server/) stop at the first failure. Then come the
# five holes listed in sc-mp pull request #6, one case each. A hole case tries several ways through the hole and prints
# "ok: H<n> ..." when the checker refuses all of them for the right reason, or "FAIL: H<n> ..." naming the ways it let
# through. No case stops the script: every one runs before it exits, so a gate with several holes shows them all.
#   H1  a missing link line file (Ninja writes none) was skipped, not refused
#   H2  a library inside -Wl,...,/opt/game.a,... (or behind a tab, in quotes, or in an @response file) was not seen on
#       the link line
#   H3  an include the line scanner could not see: a comment inside the directive (#/**/include), a split directive,
#       a lone carriage return that ends a line, a NUL byte, a quote the reader takes for a digit separator
#   H4  another spelling of the directive: the %:include digraph, #import
#   H5  an include of server/tests/*.h (any folder below server/) was admitted into the production sources
#   B0  ordinary GCC/Clang linker options were rejected (positive controls)
#   B1  an allowlisted system header resolved to a same-named project file
#   B2  an SDK header could be shadowed by a project wrapper
#   B3  a project-root include directory could shadow a transitive system header
#   B4  a same-basename source outside server/ could replace a reviewed server source
#   B5  the shared plugins/multiplayer/relay_wire.h was outside the production source scan
#   B6  library search paths were not rejected
#   B7  CMake archive substitutions or duplicate archive inputs were not rejected
#   B8  raw .obj objects and unknown positional linker inputs were not rejected
#   B9  linker-script/plugin/remap options, including -Xlinker forwarding, were not rejected
#   B10 compiler include aliases and driver configuration/wrapper/plugin overrides were not rejected
# Two more cases guard the rewritten include reader against regressions the review of the first rewrite found. They
# are not holes of the old gate (it refused these), so they are labelled R:
#   R1  form feed and vertical tab count as blanks around the directive, as they did for the old line scanner
#   R2  a quote that only looks like a digit separator cannot open a comment that does not exist and hide an include
# Two controls show that includes inside one-line comments and strings are still accepted, and that an include on a
# line of its own inside a multi-line comment is refused anyway (the plain reading is not fooled by comments).
