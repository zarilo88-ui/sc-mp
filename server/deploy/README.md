# Installing sco-relay on a Linux server

This folder is the install kit for the relay server described in [../README.md](../README.md). One command builds the
relay from this repository, installs it on a plain Linux machine and runs it. The relay is for a LAN or a VPN: it drops
every address outside them (see [Who can join](#who-can-join)). This project runs no relays and keeps no list of them, so
the kit helps you run your own for your own players.

**Not run on a real VM. Not run in game.** What was run is listed under [Evidence](#evidence).

## The command

```
sudo sh server/deploy/install.sh
```

Run it from your own copy of this repository (a clone or an unpacked archive) on the machine that will host the relay. It
needs root, because it makes an account, writes `/etc` and `/usr/local/bin`, and sets up a service.

The installer uses a dedicated `sco-relay` user and group. If either already exists, it requires a non-root UID, that
group's GID as the primary group, a non-login shell, `/nonexistent` home, no supplementary groups, and no other account or
group sharing the UID or GID. It also requires `passwd -S sco-relay` to report status `L`, which means password
authentication is locked; it does not claim to prove that no password hash exists. It stops on a mismatch instead of
adopting an unrelated identity. These checks use the identities and memberships visible through the host's NSS `getent`
and `id` configuration; they cannot verify entries those backends do not expose or prevent a concurrent administrator
changing them.
It also stops if `/etc/sco-relay` or the config file path, including any existing ancestor, is a symbolic link, or if the
config path is not a regular file. These are path checks before the ownership and mode changes; shell checks cannot make
those later filesystem operations atomic against a concurrent privileged path change.

With systemd, the command installs a service that starts at boot, starts it, and returns. **Without systemd** (a container, a
minimal image) there is no service to start, so the command itself becomes the relay: after printing where the passphrase is,
which port to open and the command for starting the relay again later, it runs the relay in the foreground as the
`sco-relay` account. It does not return. Press Ctrl+C, or send it SIGTERM, to stop the relay; it tells the players and exits 0.

**A safeguard, not a defence.** Root runs cmake and the compiler on the tree, so the installer never builds the tree you ran
it from. It copies the tree (without `.git` and build folders) into a new folder under `/var/tmp` that it makes for this run
(owned by root, closed to everyone else, removed when the installer ends), keeping owners and modes, and checks the copy.
It builds only the copy. The check refuses, and changes nothing:

- a symbolic link, or anything that is neither a regular file nor a folder (the repository has none, and the build would follow
  a link out of the copy);
- a file or folder owned by anyone but root and the user who ran `sudo`;
- a file or folder writable by everyone;
- a file or folder writable by a group, unless the group is root's (gid 0) or the owner's private group: a group named like the
  owning user, with nobody listed in it, that is no other account's primary group. A plain `git clone` made by the user who
  then runs `sudo` passes on Ubuntu and Fedora; a group shared between users does not.

This catches common mistakes: a clone with loose permissions, a stray symlink. It does not protect you from someone who
already controls your copy, because root still builds and runs what is in it. So run the installer only from a copy you made
and trust.

## What it does, in this order

1. **Copies and checks the tree** (above), so that what is checked is what is built.
2. **Checks the tools.** The build needs cmake 3.20 or newer, a C++20 compiler (`g++`), `make`, and the CA certificates
   (so that cmake can check the certificate of its download; it looks for the bundle where Debian, Ubuntu, Alpine, Fedora,
   RHEL, openSUSE and SLES keep it). On Debian and Ubuntu it installs what is missing with `apt-get`. On any other
   distribution it names what is missing and stops without changing anything; install those with your package manager and
   run it again.
3. **Builds only the relay** from the copy, with cmake's Unix Makefiles generator, in the new folder (every run builds from
   scratch; a few minutes). No tests and no plugin are built. The build downloads the sco-core SDK files that
   [cmake/ScoSdk.cmake](../../cmake/ScoSdk.cmake) and [cmake/ScoCoreSource.cmake](../../cmake/ScoCoreSource.cmake) pin, and
   refuses them unless their SHA-256 matches the one kept in this repository. That download and `apt-get` are the only
   network use; the relay itself opens one UDP port and makes no other connection.
4. **Installs** the program, the account and the config (the table below).
5. **Tells you** where the passphrase is, which UDP port to open, and who can join. It never prints the passphrase.
6. **Runs it.** With systemd running, it enables the service so that it comes back after a reboot, and starts it (a second
   run restarts it, so the new program is the one that runs). Without systemd it runs the relay in the foreground, as said above.

| Path | What | Who |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/usr/local/bin/sco-relay` | the program | root, mode 0755 |
| `sco-relay` (system account and group) | runs the relay; password authentication is locked (`passwd -S` status `L`), no login shell or home folder | |
| `/etc/sco-relay/sco-relay.conf` | the one config file: [the example](../sco-relay.example.conf) with a fresh random passphrase | root, group `sco-relay`, mode 0640 |
| `/etc/systemd/system/sco-relay.service` | the unit ([sco-relay.service](sco-relay.service)); only where systemd is running | root, mode 0644 |

It changes nothing else, and leaves nothing in your copy of the repository or in `/var/tmp`. In particular it does not touch
the firewall.

## The passphrase

The first install writes a random 64-digit hexadecimal passphrase into the `passphrase =` line of
`/etc/sco-relay/sco-relay.conf`. Players type it to join (the plugin takes 12 to 128 bytes). Only root and the `sco-relay`
account can read the file, and the installer does not print the passphrase. Read it with `sudo grep '^passphrase' /etc/sco-relay/sco-relay.conf`
and send it to your players over a channel you trust.

Running the installer again keeps the config, and with it the passphrase, so your players do not need a new one. To change
it, edit the file and restart the relay.

Every other setting (the port, the player limit, the server name, the timers, nearby-only forwarding) is in the same file,
one comment line each, and changing one never needs a rebuild.

## The port and the firewall

The relay listens on one UDP port, 64091 unless `port` in the config says otherwise. Open that port in your firewall for the
network your players use (your LAN, or your VPN), never for the whole internet. The installer does not open it for you.

## Who can join

The relay applies the LAN rule of [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) (guardrail 2) through the kit's `ScopedTransport`:
it answers loopback and the private ranges, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16` and `169.254.0.0/16`, and drops
every datagram from any other address. That has a plain consequence for a rented server:

- A server reached over its public address, with players connecting from their home internet addresses, **does not work**.
  The relay drops those addresses, and the players' own sc-offline blocks every public address too (found by reading its
  source, not run in game).
- Put the server and the players on a **VPN whose addresses are private** (a WireGuard network, for example, with addresses in
  `10.x.x.x`), and have the players join the server's VPN address.
- If your VPN uses other addresses, name them in `allowed_addresses` in the config (each range `/8` or narrower), then restart
  the relay. The relay then accepts them; what the players' game does with them is the next point.
- Players' sc-offline currently blocks CGNAT ranges such as `100.64.0.0/10`, the range Tailscale uses (found by reading
  its source, not run in game). Until that changes, a VPN that hands out those addresses may not work for them even when the
  relay allows the range. This is about the players' side; the relay's `allowed_addresses` cannot fix it.

Traffic is signed with the passphrase but **not encrypted**. Players who need privacy use a VPN, as for the rest of the traffic.

## Running it

With systemd:

| To | Run |
| --- | --- |
| see whether it runs | `systemctl status sco-relay` |
| read the log | `journalctl -u sco-relay -f` |
| apply a config change | `sudo systemctl restart sco-relay` |
| stop it | `sudo systemctl stop sco-relay` (the relay tells the players, logs a last stats line and exits 0) |
| start it again | `sudo systemctl start sco-relay` |

Upgrade by updating your copy of the repository and running the installer again. Players and relay must use the same
multiplayer protocol generation, so upgrade them together; the generation and what it covers are in the plugin's
[protocol instructions](../../plugins/multiplayer/README.md#co-presence-not-shared-simulation).

The unit retries a crash after five seconds. Three failures within one minute make systemd refuse to start the service
again ("start request repeated too quickly"), so that a bad config does not loop. That lasts until the minute has passed
or until you run `sudo systemctl reset-failed sco-relay`. So fix the file, then run `sudo systemctl reset-failed sco-relay`
and `sudo systemctl restart sco-relay`. (The installer does the `reset-failed` itself.) A clean stop is not restarted.

Without systemd, the installer's run of the relay is the foreground run described above. To start the relay again later
without running the installer, use the command the installer printed. Changing to the `sco-relay` account needs root, so it
starts with `sudo` (leave the `sudo` off in a root shell). For example:

```
sudo setpriv --reuid=sco-relay --regid=sco-relay --init-groups /usr/local/bin/sco-relay /etc/sco-relay/sco-relay.conf
```

It also runs until you press Ctrl+C or send it SIGTERM, then exits 0. If systemd is installed but not running (a chroot, an
image build), run the installer on the machine once it has booted, or accept the foreground run.

## Remove it

Not covered by the evidence below, and plain commands:

```
sudo systemctl disable --now sco-relay
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/sco-relay.service /usr/local/bin/sco-relay
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo rm -r /etc/sco-relay          # this deletes the passphrase
sudo userdel sco-relay             # the group goes with it
```

## What is not here

- **No container image.** The relay runs as a plain service, or in the foreground. The kit builds on the machine that runs it.
- **No release binary.** sc-mp publishes none, so the kit builds from source.
- **No Windows installer.** On Windows, build the relay and start it by hand (see [../README.md](../README.md), "Run").
- **No firewall changes, no service manager other than systemd.**

## Evidence

The kit was run on a build machine, from a committed copy of the repository, by a driver script that is not part of this
repository. In fresh `ubuntu:24.04` and `debian:12` containers (no systemd) an ordinary user ran `sudo sh server/deploy/install.sh`
once, from a clone-like copy with group-writable files in a private group whose number differs from the user's number. That
one command installed the missing tools, built and installed the relay and stayed in the foreground as it. The driver checked
that the relay's own process, running as `sco-relay`, held the UDP port and logged that its session is up, and joined it with
a probe player using the generated passphrase (a wrong passphrase was refused). SIGTERM ended the command with exit status 0
and released the port. The relay was then started again with the printed command, run through `sudo` by that user, and the
installer was run a second time, which kept the passphrase. The driver also checked that the installer refuses, before it
installs anything, a copy with a symbolic link, a file writable by everyone, a folder writable by everyone, a file writable
by a group that is not its owner's private group (a shared group whose number equals the user's, a foreign group, and a group
named like the owner that lists a member) and a file owned by another user; and that a `build-relay` folder reached through a
symlink, holding a CMake cache, is never read. In an `ubuntu:24.04` container running systemd, with the build tools already
in the image so that nothing was installed while it ran, it did the same through the service, and the enabled service came
back after the container was restarted.

The CTest `relay_install_guard_checks` exercises only the account/path validation helpers, using mocked account commands and
temporary paths. It does not execute the installer, create a real account, or change file ownership or service settings.
That is all. The installer was **not run on a real VM** by this review, and nothing here was **run in game**: no Star Citizen
process was involved. The sandbox lines of the unit were exercised in a privileged container only. The `su` fallback of the
foreground run (for a machine without `setpriv`) and distributions other than Ubuntu and Debian were not run. CTest does not
run the installer, because that needs root, a container and the network.
